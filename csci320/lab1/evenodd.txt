   0, 00000000 has EVEN parity (0)
   1, 01110001 has EVEN parity (0)
   2, 01010001 has ODD  parity (1)
   3, 11111111 has EVEN parity (0)
   4, 01111111 has ODD  parity (1)

1. Yes, the output is correct and expected
2. There are 5 runs of the main loop
3. Register A changes the value at every clock cycle.
4. The main read the value of A at every clock edge.
5. Register C changes the value at every clock cycle multiple times.
