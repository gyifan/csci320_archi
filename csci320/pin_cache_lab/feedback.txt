140 points total plus the possibility of 20 bonus points.

[10] q1 & q2: 5 points each
[5] q3: 5 points
[10] test1 works: 10 points
[10] test2 created and checks fully associative cache
[20] q4-q7: 5 points each
[15] test3 checks LRU, RANDOM, and FIFO replacement, 5 points each
[30] result.png or pdf looks good
3/[5] test5 verifies hardware prefetch of next line

[5] q8: speedup calculation is correct given simulation results
